===========================================

Case + Code Overview
--------------------
This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project, a project
to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.

This use case shows how RTI Connext can be used in cnjunction with ENSCO IData 
to drive informayion in UI applications. This allows to create a plugn and play 
UI which can receive input from different sources. This use case shows a simple
example using a pitch and roll indicator however the same concept apply to more
complex UIs. 

This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating connected UI 
application based on RTI Connext and ENSCO IData. Additional information about 
this use case can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/developers/case-code/).
